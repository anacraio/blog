In mid February of 2022, external stressors were
exceptionally high, which were further exacerbated by
physical isolation. For some time, I've intended to pick up
a creative outlet again, but I hadn't dedicated the
cycles.

One evening, someone sent me an image of a painting
they had made for me, that included the words, "create
something - anything."

In that moment, I took it to heart. Later that evening, I
ordered my first synthesizer, a Moog Mother-32, which
happened to be on sale by a couple hundred dollars.

I've only spent about an hour or two a week since
then, but the endeavor has been a most welcome and cathartic 
experience. I continue to grow my tiny arsenal of synths 
and spend a little more time each week than before.

This new effort has been my first attempt at electronic
music outside of composition on the C64 as a child.

Up until now, I have not bothered to record much - but I
I have decided to start recording a bit and grow a personal
library. Recording will be executed via audacity or ardour, at 
most, with no post-processing, mixing, or mastering.

This little space on the world wide web will serve as
an archive, as well as weblog, of these moments in time
and related musings.

Thanks for flying into my little web - don't get caught. And by god,

*MAKE NOISE*
